# Code Mode — Implementation Discipline

## Institutional memory

- Embed invariant intent in comments.
- Explain why responsibilities exist.
- Preserve separation of concerns.

## Safety discipline

- Do not introduce hidden scheduling.
- Do not blur execution boundaries.
- If design conflict appears, escalate to Architect mode.

## Maintainability

- Favor clarity over cleverness.
- Keep components cohesive.
- Avoid silent coupling.
