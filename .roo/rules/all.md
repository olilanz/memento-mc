# Global Reasoning Discipline

Applies to all modes.

## No guessing

- No silent assumptions.
- No invented constraints.
- Ask when unclear.

## Invariant continuity

Architectural invariants are institutional memory.
They must be preserved across modes.
If behavior changes, invariants must be reviewed.

## Convergence discipline

Do not converge automatically.
Surface trade-offs when present.
