# Memento: Natural Renewal — The Story

Minecraft worlds remember everything.

Every step, every tunnel, every abandoned camp
is carried forward forever.

Memento exists to change that — gently.

## Memory and Forgetting

Not every place deserves to last forever.

Some places matter:
- homes
- towns
- monuments

Other places are simply passed through.

Memento does not decide this for you.
You decide.

## Anchors

Memento introduces anchors — expressions of intent.

### Remembering

Some places are marked to be remembered.
They are protected from forgetting and renewal.

### Forgetting

Other places are safe to forget.

Forgetting is not destruction.
It is letting the world heal.

## Witherstones

A Witherstone is placed where forgetting is allowed.

It does not act immediately.

Instead, it **matures over time**.

As it matures:
- nothing changes
- nothing breaks
- nothing is forced

When the Witherstone has fully matured,
its surrounding land is **marked for forgetting**.

## When Forgetting Happens

Forgetting only begins when the land is left alone.

If any part of the land is still loaded:
- by players
- by creatures
- by the world itself

…nothing happens.

When the land is finally free,
the world lets go of its memory.

The land renews.

## What Players Experience

Most of the time:
- nothing

Occasionally:
- familiar land returns to nature
- caves shift
- terrain feels new again

Memento is meant to be invisible when idle
and understandable when it acts.

---

## A Living World

Memento does not erase history.
It makes room for new stories.

What matters is remembered.
What does not is allowed to fade.

That is natural renewal.
