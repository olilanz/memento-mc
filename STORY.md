# Memento: Natural Renewal — Design Intention

Memento is built around a simple idea:  
**worlds should evolve naturally, keeping what players care about and renewing what they don’t.**

Minecraft worlds grow endlessly, and players leave traces everywhere. Over time, unused terrain can accumulate noise, old generation artifacts, and performance overhead. But players also build memories—structures, paths, and places that matter.

The goal of Memento is to let the world breathe:

- **Anchors** protect meaningful locations.
- **Forgetters** guide where renewal should happen.
- **Unused land gently regenerates**, keeping the world fresh.
- **No one loses anything important.**

This is not destruction—it’s maintenance, continuity, and regeneration.

All mechanics remain simple, practical, and server-side only.  
Players using vanilla clients can interact with Memento Stones without needing any additional mods.

Memento aims to be invisible when it should be, and obvious when it matters.
